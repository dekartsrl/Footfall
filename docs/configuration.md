To configure the app you have to go inside the bin/data folder and edit `config.xml`.

Configuration will differ from environment to environment. Important parameters
are UPLOADURL and LOCATIONID. UPLOADURL must be configured to point to a server
that can process data sent by the app, LOCATIONID will point where this data is
coming from and identify the device.
